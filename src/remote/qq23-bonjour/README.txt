Zero-Configuration Networking in Qt Examples
============================================

This package contains the source code for the examples described in the
"Zero-Configuration Networking in Qt" article in Qt Quarterly 23.

The "fortuneclient", "fortuneserver" and "threadedfortuneserver" examples are
versions of the equivalent Qt examples that have been adapted for use with
Zeroconf implementations. These are provided with qmake project files which
can be used to configure and build the source code.
