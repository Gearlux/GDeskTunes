DONATIONS NEEDED!  If you are a business you should be contributing regular donations.  If you are a generous individual, consider regular donations.  Most people simply take and run - leaving me to foot the bill.  That's not nice.  Some businesses even drop their customers onto me to provide direct support to the customer (ahem, PayPal).  That's just evil.  Even if you can't afford a small, one time donation of $10, at least drop a line saying how much you appreciate the effort put into this project (and, optionally, what you use OpenSSL for).  Lots of complaints and few compliments is discouraging.
